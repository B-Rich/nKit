nKit
=============

Bootstrap kit for Node.js projects. A toolkit providing things you may need to get started with a quick Node.js-Hack.

This project is intended to be forked as a means of starting a new project in a hackathon. It is designed to be as
open as possible, allowing for development in as many languages as possible. Support for development in a language
is considered the ability to code in that language with autocompilation to JS or CSS. Currently languages are only
supported client side though it is intended a method of supporting server side language compilation also be developed.
